<h1>Hi, I’m @shakmatton!</h1>

Who am I?

- A beginner in coding, but with experience in some topics of Computer Science (theory, data structures and so on) and 3D Computer Graphics (modeling, texturing).

Why are you here?

- Tech matures and its adoption grows wider each day. Learning to code is an opportunity to use creative technology for enhancing human experiences.

What is your goal?

- As a novice in coding, my goal is to master the required skills for creating visually appealing websites and webapps (traditional & mobile). However, my ultimate goal is moving towards AR/VR technology: I believe the real purpose of technology lies where the digital and the real intersect.

How do you intend to achieve your goal?

- I intend to learning by doing, starting with tech basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and moving towards advanced frameworks (React, Three.js). Then, I intend to build AR/VR apps as an useful and exciting extension of our lives, by embracing the ability of superimposing contents and enabling creative connection between mixed realities.

Do you have any hobbies?

- Besides tech, I also pursue knowledge of foreign languages (specially english, spanish, portuguese, french, german, italian). I enjoy chatting with different people from around the world. So, feel free to reach me or to talk to me in hundreds of languages, business related or not!
